# EEE3096S Practical 2
## Benchmarking Assistance

These files are adapted from [this practical](https://github.com/kcranky/EEE3096S/tree/master/Prac2) as a part of the Embedded Systems II course at UCT. They aim to assist in the benchmarking process required for the second practical, by adding csv output, and some loop functionality.
